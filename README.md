# Massa
## The Decentralized and Scaled Blockchain
### Massa is a truly decentralized blockchain controlled by thousands of people. With the breakthrough multithreaded technology, we're set for mass adoption.

## Introduction
  

  * [Massa](https://massa.net/)  is a new blockchain reaching a high transaction throughput in a decentralized network. Our research is published in this **[technical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09029.pdf)**. It shows that throughput of 10'000 transactions per second is reached even in a fully decentralized network with thousands of nodes.
